Initial meeting minutes and other stuff
updated 19th March to reflect final project

I suggest we each do stuff we haven't done before. Let's atleast make sure we get our 25% dis-comfort zone covered, that's our main aim here imho, more important than producing an MVP.

closing date for new project ideas, 17-mar.

## suggestions
1. github projects (kanban board)
    * prs => develop => master
2. push your work daily
3. regular voip
5. linting
6. testing ... yikes!
